//! scry-octagon — the pure octagon relational abstract domain for scry
//! (FEAT-010, v0.9; Miné HOSC 2006, AC-011).
//!
//! This crate holds the *algebra* of the octagon domain and nothing
//! else: no Wasm parsing, no WIT bindings, no I/O. It is the relational
//! analogue of [`scry-taint`] / [`scry-provenance`] — a pure,
//! dependency-free crate that compiles to BOTH `wasm32-wasip2` (where
//! `wasm-lattice` delegates its WIT `octagon-*` exports to it, so the
//! *shipped* relational code is exactly this code) AND natively (where
//! `scry-host-tests` falsifies the lattice laws + concretization
//! soundness against it).
//!
//! ## The domain
//!
//! An octagon over `dim` variables `x_0 … x_{dim-1}` is the set of
//! points satisfying constraints of the form `±x_i ± x_j ≤ c`. We use
//! the standard Difference-Bound-Matrix (DBM) encoding (Miné): each
//! variable `x_k` has a *positive* form at index `2k` and a *negative*
//! form at index `2k+1`. Writing `v(2k) = x_k` and `v(2k+1) = -x_k`,
//! the DBM entry `m[i][j]` is an upper bound on `v(j) - v(i)`:
//!
//! ```text
//!   v(j) - v(i) ≤ m[i][j]      for all 0 ≤ i, j < 2·dim
//! ```
//!
//! Every octagonal constraint maps to one (or two) DBM entries; e.g.
//! `x_a - x_b ≤ c` is `v(2a) - v(2b) ≤ c`, i.e. `m[2b][2a] = c`.
//!
//! ## Soundness role (REQ-001, REQ-002)
//!
//! The matrix is stored row-major in a `Vec<i64>` of length `(2·dim)²`,
//! with [`INF`] (= `i64::MAX`) the +∞ sentinel ("no bound"). All
//! arithmetic is saturating and INF-absorbing ([`sadd`]) so a bound can
//! never silently wrap. [`close`] is the standard Floyd–Warshall
//! shortest-path closure: it is **sound** (it never drops a concrete
//! point — it only makes implicit bounds explicit) and detects
//! infeasibility (a negative diagonal ⇒ ⊥). [`join`] is the pointwise
//! max of two *closed* DBMs, which over-approximates the union; [`meet`]
//! is the pointwise min (exact intersection); [`leq`] compares closed
//! DBMs pointwise. These are the operations the analyzer dispatches
//! through the `pulseengine:wasm-lattice/domain` WIT boundary (DD-008).
//!
//! Deferred to a later FEAT-010 slice: Miné's *strong/tight* closure
//! (the extra `m[i][j] ≤ (m[i][ī] + m[j̄][j]) / 2` tightening that buys
//! precision, not soundness), and the analyzer's loop-carried
//! relational fixpoint.

// `add_bound` above is the low-level single-cell tightening. The octagon
// the analyzer carries needs a handful of higher-level, COHERENT operations:
// the transfer functions for the Wasm ops that move/relate locals
// (`local.set` of a const / copy / `x := y + c`), the per-variable
// projection back to an integer interval, a `forget` (havoc on write), and
// `narrow`. These live here (pure algebra) so the analyzer integration in a
// later slice is just dispatch; they are falsified by the γ-sweep tests
// below, exactly like the lattice ops.
//
// ## Coherence
//
// A well-formed octagon DBM is *coherent*: `m[i][j] = m[j̄][ī]` where `ī =
// i^1` swaps a variable's positive (`2k`) and negative (`2k+1`) form (since
// `v(i^1) = -v(i)`, the entry `m[j̄][ī]` bounds the same difference
// `v(j)-v(i)`). `add_bound` sets a single cell; the helpers below set both
// the cell and its coherent twin, which is what lets `close` propagate a
// difference bound + a unary bound into a tighter unary bound (the whole
// point of the relational product: `i ≤ n-1 ∧ n ≤ 10 ⟹ i ≤ 9`).
